# project1
 
1) Describe your project:
- This website is created to introduce Newcastle United, an English Premier League soccer team. This website is consisted of 5 pages (index, history, news, roster, form). As its name states (Newcastle United 101), its aim is to introduce the team to someone who has no idea about what it is. 

2) Your motivations behind it:
- I am a huge fan of Newcastle United but I feel like, at least in the US, that not many people know about the team. I wanted to create a site which, while might not make someone expert on the team right away, will at least allow someone to learn about the team.

3) Your website's live Internet address:
